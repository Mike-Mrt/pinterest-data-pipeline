## Introduction

The Pinterest data pipeline simulation project will in effect use many components of the AWS ecosystem combined with Databricks to build a data pipeline. Ths pipeline will incorporate both batch data and streaming data to ensure that the pipeline is robust and utilise the cloud so that the the pipeline is scalable, cost- efficient, highly secure, reliable and completely flexible according to the volume of data and compute resources utilised by the system. This will ensure the incoming data is clean and ready to be analysed to ensure the customer has the most optimised Pinterest feed according to their personal preferences. 

This project utilises many components from the AWS ecosystem to build the pipeline, these include:

- AWS EC2 (virtual servers in the cloud)
- AWS S3 (scalable storage in the cloud)
- AWS IAM (manage access to AWS resources)
- AWS MSK (fully managed, highly scalable, and secure service for Apache Kafka)
- AWS API Gateway (build, deploy and manage APIs)

To ensure that all fo these components work together to create a robust data pipeline we also require:

- Apache Kafka
- Apache Spark
- Apache Airflow
- Apache Kinesis
- Databricks
- Couple of GitHub packages which will aid in IAM authentication and package to communicate with the MSK cluster.
- GitHub (version control platform)

The details of all of the packages utilised within this project will be outlined in the [Installation Instructions](#installation-instructions).
